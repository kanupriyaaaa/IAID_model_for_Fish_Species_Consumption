# IAID_model_for_Fish_Species_Consumption
I created an Inverse Almost Ideal Demand (IAID) model for the consumption of fishes in Cambodia. The original data was collected from the waters of Cambodia and the dependence of their population on fisheries is a concern for the government. I used three multivariate regression models, MLR (Multivariate linear regression),  SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regressions), and ANN (Neural Networks). Initial data cleaning helped me create a combiend take for the type of fishes, what they are used for and the type of food prepared from them and the catch and consumption informaiton. I have also compared the results from the three models using a comparitive box plot. The models involved putting constriats as well for which I used scipy calcualtions and other calcualtions including RMSE (root mean square error). It was found that the SUR and MLR both provided accurate results, varying by a small factor as shown in the box plot.
